            The John&apos;s Burger Sandwich Shop opened in early August 2012,
            and its first store was located on Roberto Freire Avenue in Capim
            Macio.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-6">
            The brand started in October 2011 with a discreet sandwich cart,
            also on Roberto Freire Avenue, next to √Åguia Piscinas. The sandwich
            shop had a limited menu, standing out for offering sandwiches made
            with artisanal burgers.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-6">
            Within five months of the cart&apos;s operation, the number of
            customers doubled, and the space became too small to meet the
            demand. It was then necessary to invest in the construction of a
            larger and more comfortable location. It took five months of work on
            the new space, which is now one of the busiest spots in the
            neighborhood.
